# HuiJia (Go Home!)

A huge problem many people face in these times is boredom and restlessness - there's only so much we can do at home! We get bored of watching netflix, of our YouTube algorithm, of the same few websites we always scroll through. 

To encourage people to stay at home, we created this website: a treasure chest of suggestions for things to do, learn, watch, and so on! It's crowd-sourced, so anyone can submit their own suggestions to help this thing grow :) You can find suggestions via categories, or with our little randomiser 'try me!' button.

Play around with the site at:
